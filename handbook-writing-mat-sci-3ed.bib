            Easy and interesting to read, without much waffle.
            Transcripts of lectures he gave at MIT, which are mostly concerned
            with his 3:16 project, though he does discuss wider issues.
            Interesting insight into the project, including his experience of
            looking at the theological literature.
            Lot's of info on the calligraphic artwork for his book,
            including how he used early version of Photoshop to
            digitize them (surprising he would spend so much time on
            this).  Surprising that several calligraphers had typos in
            their interpretation of the verses, which Knuth usually
            Photoshopped away!
              p. 20: `The amount of terror that lives in a speaker's
            stomach when giving a lecture is proportional to the
            square of the amount he doesn't know about his audience.'
              p. 28: used randomization when grading papers (looking at
            only certain pages of a program).
              p. 32: `When I'm in a book store nowadays, or when I'm at a
            conference looking at a table full of new books, I try to
            gauge how good the books are by picking them up and--yes,
            guess it's okay to reveal the secret---I turn to page 316.
            I try to read that page rather carefully, and this gives me an
            impression of the whole book.  (Often the book is too
            short; then I use page 100.)'
              p. 44: `There's a famous anecdote about a man who was
            depressed and randomly opened the Bible and found the
            verse that said. `and Judas went out and hung himself.'
            That wasn't very helpful, so he opened another one and it
            said, `go out and do thou likewise'; and that was even
            more depressing. Then he went on to find `whatever thou
            doest, do it quickly.'
              p. 47: the so-called sequences of junk DNA are going to
            turn out to be copyright notices and patent protections.
              p. 131: `If I watch a lecture in which my fonts appear
            in the slides, I can't concentrate on that lecture; I
            keep wondering whether I shouldn't have changed the
            letter S a little bit.'",

             Western society to the mid-1960s not, as it happens, because of
             the advent of the contraceptive pill, but because of the growth in
             availability of canned factor analysis routines in university
             computer centres.''
             Best chapter is the one by Eysenck, a former student.
             Some of his points:
             - Hearnshaw passed the opportunity to look at Cohen's `stack of
               Burtania', implying not a thorough biographer. (p. 113)
             - ``Burt wrote much of the journal [British Journal of Statistical
               Psychology] himself, often under assumed names''. (p. 115)
             - Burt altered a review of E's book to make it much more
               critical. (p. 116)
             - Media leaped on chance to destroy Burt because they didn't like
               his view that genetic factors play an important part in
               determining intelligence. (p. 120)",

            raised is: the book is about the Landau damping theorem with Mouhout,
            so why didn't Mouhout get a Fields medal too, since the theorem is
            mentioned in the citation.  Written in a sloppy style, which largely works.
            But hard to see why some poems and theorems are there (sometimes the
            notes at the back explain).  The italic typeface used for quotes etc.
            is really jarring.  There are quite a few pages of tedious,
            unintelligible equations.  When he describes some of his earlier
            results it is clear they fit Dennis Sherwood's definition of
            creativity, bringing disparate subjects together.
